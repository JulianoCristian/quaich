# quaich

A Scala “Serverless” Microframework for AWS Lambda, inspired by Amazon's Chalice (https://github.com/awslabs/chalice)

## WTF is a "quaich"

Amazon named their version of the AWS Lamba Microframework “Chalice”, which references what we suppose is a perfectly acceptable drinking vessel.

Being partial to whisky, however, the quaich (pronounced as 'quake') – A Scottish two-handled drinking bowl, often used to serve whisky – sounded like a better inspiration. Sir Walter Scott was said to have served whisky from a quaich carved from the elm tree that served as the Duke of Wellington's command post at the Battle of Waterloo. Which is pretty awesome.
